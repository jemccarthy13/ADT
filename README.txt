TODO:
- battle engine picks default move for every turn
- Options don't work
- pause menu selections only bare skeletons
- need world map sprite for pokegear
- sprites in battles collide with frame b/c of sizing difference
- wild encounters don't work
- need grass animation when walking through wild
- map should be expanded and should include indoors locations
- interact with world map (e.g. items, signs)
- prof elm's intro scenes

KNOWN BUGS:
- occasionally the player will be in the process of moving
	when a trainer sees them.  The behavior is a glitch, 
	the trainer should not move in to battle
